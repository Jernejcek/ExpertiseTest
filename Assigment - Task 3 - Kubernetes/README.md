# Simple CTS Backend Application with Kubernetes

The Simple CTS Backend Application can be effectively deployed and managed using Kubernetes, providing a resilient infrastructure that can handle failures of compute nodes and automatically scale in response to increased CPU demand. This README.md file outlines how you can set up the infrastructure and provides configuration files for the necessary tools.

## Why Use Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that offers numerous benefits for deploying and managing applications, including:

2. High availability: Kubernetes provides built-in mechanisms for ensuring the availability of your application even if individual compute nodes fail. It automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, minimizing downtime.

3. Scalability: Kubernetes allows you to horizontally scale your application by adding or removing compute nodes. It can automatically scale based on predefined metrics, such as CPU usage, ensuring your application can handle increased demand.

4. Resource optimization: Kubernetes optimizes resource utilization by intelligently scheduling containers on compute nodes based on available resources. It ensures efficient utilization of resources while maintaining application performance.

5. Ease of management: Kubernetes simplifies the management of containerized applications through its declarative configuration approach. You can define the desired state of your application, and Kubernetes handles the underlying infrastructure, ensuring it matches the desired state.

## Setting Up Infrastructure with Kubernetes

To set up infrastructure that is resilient to failures and scales automatically using Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. Install Kubernetes: Set up a Kubernetes cluster using a platform like GGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), or deploy your own cluster using tools like kubeadm.

2. Create Deployment: Define a Kubernetes Deployment manifest to describe the desired state of your Simple CTS Backend Application. This includes specifying the container image, resource limits, and any necessary environment variables or volumes.

3. Set Up Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Configure an HPA to automatically scale the number of application replicas based on CPU usage. Define the target CPU utilization percentage and minimum/maximum number of replicas in the HPA manifest.

## Set up CTS with Kubernetes

1. Start by installing Minikube, a tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine. Visit the Minikube GitHub page at github.com/kubernetes/minikube and follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.

2. Next, install kubectl, the command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for your specific operating system to find the instructions on how to install kubectl.

3. Once you have Minikube and kubectl installed, start the Minikube cluster by running the following command in your terminal: minikube start

4. Now, it's time to deploy your application to the Kubernetes cluster. Assuming you have a configuration file named "backend.yaml" in your current folder, apply the configuration by executing the following command: kubectl apply -f backend.yaml

5. To check the status of your deployment and see if the pod is running without any issues, run the command: kubectl get pods

By following these steps, you will be able to set up and deploy your application using Kubernetes. If you encounter any problems or have further questions, feel free to ask for assistance.
